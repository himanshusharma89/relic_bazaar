We propose an app with the vision to put back the traditional market of vintage on the tides of the e-commerce boom!. The UI is specifically made to provide a retro feel. We are using a blockchain-based system for payments behind the scenes to ensure privacy and encryption. The registration is simple and can be done using one's Google account as well. Using some beautiful yet concise forms we eliminate the paperwork for sellers. The recommendation engine tends to learn over time about one's taste and suggests similar items to buy. Computer vision-based techniques are used for quality assessment.
